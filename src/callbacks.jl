    key = Revise.add_callback(f, files, modules=nothing; key=gensym())

Add a user-specified callback, to be executed during the first run of
`revise()` after a file in `files` or a module in `modules` is changed on the
file system. If `all` is set to `true`, also execute the callback whenever any
file already monitored by Revise changes. In an interactive session like the
REPL, Juno or Jupyter, this means the callback executes immediately before
executing a new command / cell.

You can use the return value `key` to remove the callback later
(`Revise.remove_callback`) or to update it using another call
to `Revise.add_callback` with `key=key`.

    entr(f, files; all=false, postpone=false, pause=0.02)
    entr(f, files, modules; all=false, postpone=false, pause=0.02)

Execute `f()` whenever files or directories listed in `files`, or code in `modules`, updates.
If `all` is `true`, also execute `f()` as soon as code updates are detected in
any module tracked by Revise.

`entr` will process updates (and block your command line) until you press Ctrl-C.
Unless `postpone` is `true`, `f()` will be executed also when calling `entr`,
regardless of file changes. The `pause` is the period (in seconds) that `entr`
will wait between being triggered and actually calling `f()`, to handle
clusters of modifications, such as those produced by saving files in certain
text editors.

# Example

```julia
entr(["/tmp/watched.txt"], [Pkg1, Pkg2]) do
    println("update")
end
```
This will print "update" every time `"/tmp/watched.txt"` or any of the code defining
`Pkg1` or `Pkg2` gets updated.
