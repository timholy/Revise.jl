    #     definition.
    #   - checking the filename. Since the "top level" file is evaluated into Main,
    #     we can't use the module-of-evaluation to find it. Here we hope that the
    #     top-level filename follows convention and matches the module. TODO?: it's
    #     possible that this needs to be supplemented with parsing.
