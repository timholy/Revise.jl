    # might contain files associated with many different packages. We have to figure
    # out which correspond to `modsym`, which we do by:
    #   - checking the module in which each file is evaluated. This suffices to
    #     detect "supporting" files, i.e., those `included` within the module
    #     definition.
    #   - checking the filename. Since the "top level" file is evaluated into Main,
    #     we can't use the module-of-evaluation to find it. Here we hope that the
    #     top-level filename follows convention and matches the module. TODO?: it's
    #     possible that this needs to be supplemented with parsing.
