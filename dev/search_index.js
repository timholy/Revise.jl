Revise supports Julia's Logging framework and can optionally record its decisions in a format suitable for later inspection. What follows is a simple series of steps you can use to turn on logging, capture messages, and then submit them with a bug report. Alternatively, more advanced developers may want to examine the logs themselves to determine the source of Revise's error, and for such users a few tips about interpreting the log messages are also provided below.","category":"page"},{"location":"debugging/#Turning-on-logging-1","page":"Debugging Revise","title":"Turning on logging","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"debugging/#","page":"Debugging Revise","title":"Debugging Revise","text":"Currently, the best way to turn on logging is within a running Julia session:","category":"page"},{"location":"debugging/#","page":"Debugging Revise","title":"Debugging Revise","text":"julia> rlogger = Revise.debug_logger()\nRevise.ReviseLogger(Revise.LogRecord[], Debug)","category":"page"},{"location":"debugging/#","page":"Debugging Revise","title":"Debugging Revise","text":"You'll use rlogger at the end to retrieve the logs.","category":"page"},{"location":"debugging/#","page":"Debugging Revise","title":"Debugging Revise","text":"Now carry out the series of julia commands and code edits that reproduces the problem.","category":"page"},{"location":"debugging/#Capturing-the-logs-and-submitting-them-with-your-bug-report-1","page":"Debugging Revise","title":"Capturing the logs and submitting them with your bug report","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"debugging/#","page":"Debugging Revise","title":"Debugging Revise","text":"Once all the revisions have been triggered and the mistake has been reproduced, it's time to capture the logs.

However, these links are static, meaning they are set up once (when the code is compiled) and are not updated when the source file changes. Because trivial manipulations to source files (e.g., the insertion of blank lines and/or comments) can change the line number of an expression without necessitating its recompilation, Revise implements a way of correcting these line numbers before they are displayed to the user. The same problem presents when using a debugger, in that one wants the debugger to display the correct code (at the correct line number) even after modifications have been made to the file.

Expression: isfile(Revise.basesrccache) This failure is quite serious, and indicates that you will be unable to access code in Base. To fix this, look for a file called \"base.cache\" somewhere in your Julia install or build directory (for the author, it is at /home/tim/src/julia-1.0/usr/share/julia/base.cache). Now compare this with the value of Revise.basesrccache. (If you're getting this failure, presumably they are different.) An important \"top level\" directory is Sys.BINDIR; if they differ already at this level, consider adding a symbolic link from the location pointed at by Sys.BINDIR to the corresponding top-level directory in your actual Julia installation.

While Revise should be able to access the code in Base and standard libraries, at the current time it is not possible for Revise to access julia's Core.Compiler module unless you clone Julia's repository and build it from source.\nskipping git tests because Revise is not under development: this warning should be harmless. Revise has built-in functionality for extracting source code using git, and it uses itself (i.e., its own git repository) for testing purposes. These tests run only if you have checked out Revise for development (pkg> dev Revise) or on the continuous integration servers (Travis and Appveyor).","category":"page"}]
