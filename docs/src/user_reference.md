# User reference

There are really only two functions that a user would be expected to call manually:
`revise` and `Revise.track`.
Other user-level constructs might apply if you want to exclude Revise from watching specific packages.

```@docs
revise
Revise.track
Revise.dont_watch_pkgs
Revise.silence
```
